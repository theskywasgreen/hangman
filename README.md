# Hangman
I have created two versions of the game Hangman. One incorporates a dictionary file of random words, another incorporates the top 250 films taken from IMDB. 

Both versions allow the player to start a new game, load a saved game or exit upon opening the program. 
The player has the option to save at the beginning of every turn as per the instructions on the odin project. 
The player can name the saved files whatever they choose and these are then saved into a folder called saved_games 
which is located in the same directory as wherever the player stores the script itself. 

I have also included a visual diagram of how many lives the player has left using the well known hangman diagram.
This is displayed to the user after every guess, whether correct or incorrect. 
The player is shown what previous guesses he/she has made and any correct ones are also shown in the correct 
place, replacing "_".
